uniforms:
  material.diffuse: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8]     # Pure white - shows light colors accurately
  material.ambient: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]     # Moderate ambient so it's not pitch black
  material.specular: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]    # Subtle specular (matte finish)
  material.shininess: 8.0               # Low shininess = diffuse surface
  material.tiling: [10.0, 10.0]         # Tile texture 10 times across the surface
